				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						How buildings are built, where they are built, and how the streets
						around them are designed directly affect your health.

					<p class="fragment">
						And those things are dictated by our laws and regulations

					<h2>Walkability</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						Just because a place has sidewalks doesn't mean people will
						want to walk there
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						Walkability refers to places that are designed to encourage walking
						by providing a safe and enjoyable experience.

					<h2>So what makes a place Walkable?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Sidewalks that are wide and clear of obstructions</p>
					<p class="fragment">Narrow buildings - variety</p>
					<p class="fragment">Shade - street trees, buildings, awnings</p>
					<p class="fragment">Safety - slow cars, separated from traffic</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Walkability and Physical Health</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						Communities where walking is a viable form of
						transportation are slimmer and have lower health costs
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						When streets are designed to focus on cars, it is at the expense
						of bike and pedestrian safety
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						Today, most air pollution comes from driving, not factories

					<h2>Livable Streets - Donald Appleyard</h2>
					<p>Late 1960's study that compared 3 residential streets in San Francisco</p>
					<p>All streets were similar except for the amount of traffic.</p>
					<p>2000 vehicles per day was considered Light Traffic, 8000 Medium traffic,
						and 16000 Heavy Traffic

					<h2>Bowling Alone - Robert Putnam</h2>
					<blockquote>
							"Each ten additional minutes in daily commuting time cuts
							involvement in community affairs by 10% - fewer public meetings
							attended, fewer committees chaired, fewer petitions signed, fewer
							church services attended and so on"

					<h2>Walkability is more Equitable</h2>
					<p class="fragment">1/3 of Americans cannot drive</p>
					<p class="fragment">Walkability gives the children and elderly independence (8-80 Cities)</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Zoning</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Adopted in Lexington in the late 1920s</p>
					<p class="fragment">Originally meant to separate land uses (Industrial/Residential)</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						Became more and more restrictive (often times as
						Civil Rights increased)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Zoning Today</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Controls land uses</p>
					<p class="fragment">Types of Residential</p>
					<p class="fragment">Types of Businesses</p>
					<p class="fragment">Also dictates certain aspects of buildings</p>

					<h2>How does zoning enforce inequality and car dependence?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="">
						Zoning can make it either illegal or prohibitively
						expensive to build housing that is inherently more affordable
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						These types of housing are sometimes referred to as Missing 
						Middle Housing on account of how rarely they are built today
						compared to the past
					</p>

				<section>
					<p class="">
						Single family zoning is an apartment ban
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						When you only allow for the most expensive type of housing you
						exclude those that can't afford it.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						Lexington's existing housing stock is ~63% single family detached
						housing, with an extra ~6% single family attached (townhomes)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>So what can we doing to fix it?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Affordability</h2>
					<p>Inclusive Zoning</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						This is when cities give developers allowances (let them build
						taller, let them build less parking) if the developer agrees to
						rent out a percentage of new units at below market rates.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">Effectiveness is still debated</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Increase the amount and variety of housing</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Change the regulations to make it
						easier to build more types of housing
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">Want to build a single family house?</p>
					<p class="fragment">Cool, just need one off street parking spot.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Want to build a duplex?</p>
					<p class="fragment">That needs 4 off street parking spaces!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Remove some of the "thousand cuts" that kill projects</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Require less parking (we are over parked as is)</li>
							<li>Relax setback requirements</li>
							<li>Allow duplexes (or even tri-plexes) by right</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Proposed ADU Ordinance</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>No lot size limit</li>

						<li>Owner occupancy only required for short term rentals</li>
